WHY DID WE CHOOSE DECISION TREE CLASSIFER?

ANSWER: WE CHOOSE DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS BECAUSE ITS ACCURACY WAS THE HIGHIST ONE AMONGST 3 CLASSIFIERS THAT IS KNN, NAIVE BAYES AND DECISION TREE.


BELOW ARE THE SCREEN SHOTS OF THE ACCURACY OF ALL 3 CLASSIFIERS.

ABOVE YOU CAN SEE THAT DECISION TREE ACCURACY WAS THE HIGHEST ONE.


HOW DID WE APROACH OUR TASK?


1.WE LOAD DATASET FROM THE SOURCE. 


2.WE SPLIT THE DATA INTO 80 AND 20% INTO 'TRAIN' AND 'TEST'.


3.WE TRAINED DECISION TREE,NAIVE BAYES, AND KNN CLASSIFIERS ON THE TRAINING DATA.


4.WE USED THE ABOVE CALASSIFEIRS TO PREDICT LABELS FOR TEST DATA.


5.WE MEASURED ACCURACY AND VISUALIZE CLASSIFICATION.



WHICH MODELS WE SELECTED AND WHY?

FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO DO SOME REASEARCH ON CLASSIFIERS AND ITS PURPOSE.

SECONDLY WE RESEARCHED ABOUT WHICH CLASSIFIERS WAS THE FASTEST ONE AND ACCURATE ONE.

AND THEN AFTER ALL THAT WE GO FOR DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS,NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIERS AND KNN CLASSIFIERS.

What were the performances of each model on local test data.?

--------------------DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS:-----------------------

Decison Tree Classifiers give accuracy for about 0.52212 compared to the rest of the 2, it was higher.
So we choose thise for kaggle submission

--------------------NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIERS:-----------------------

Naive Bayes Classifiers give accuracy for about 0.88929 compared to the Decison Tree Classifier and KNN, is low so we did not choose this for
kaggle submission.

--------------------KNN CLASSIFIERS:-----------------------

KNN Classifiers give accuracy for about 0.88936 compared to the Decison Tree Classifier, is low and compared to Naive Bayes it was higher so we did not choose this for
kaggle submission because its accuracy was not higher than Decision Tree Classifier.

PROBLEM WE FACED?

ANSWER: THE PROBLEM WE FACED AT FIRST WAS WE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT CLASSIFIERS BUT ALL THANKS TO SIR. FAROOQ  FOR HELPING US.
