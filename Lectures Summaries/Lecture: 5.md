Evaluation Algorithm best example is a large university scheduling time table . to solve algorithm by using british algorithm, so a search tree is Known as search 
space.In N queen problem , heuristics is the number of pairs of queen that are attacking each other , either directly or indirectly .
In local search , we dont need path only solution. The example of optimization is genetic algorithm. Np-Hard have only solutions on exponentials.
